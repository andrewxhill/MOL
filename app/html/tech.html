                        Map of Life (MOL) aims to develop a conceptual and cyberinfrastructure framework 
                        for provisioning and improving reliable species geographic range information. 
                        To achieve this goal, MOL will provide a diversity of analyses that can be used 
                        to improve the knowledge of species ranges and facilitate spatially explicit 
                        wiki-style user range map quality control and data upload.  Through web browser 
                        applications and APIs running on front-end servers in the cloud, simple analyses will be exposed that allow the user to filter and combine point data, species habitat data, and environmental data to name a few. Longer running analyses will be deployed on either MOL back-end servers or run on external services (e.g., Google Earth Engine).   For example, a user may want to use a modeling algorithm to create a summary species distributional model based at fine-scale on a set of distributional and environmental datasets.   The combination of applications, APIs, and a flexible server architecture allows MOL to deliver data rapidly to consumers while providing a responsive toolkit for improving those data

                        Map of Life stores and displays multiple data types, such as: expert opinion range maps; point data from various providers and amateur users; checklist-based occurrences; habitat preference data; environmental data layers representing climate, land-cover, terrain; and fine-scale species distributional modeling outputs that integrate the different data.  Each of these data types will require their own optimal storage and visualization solutions.

                    <p>
                        Due to this diversity, MOL is built upon several technologies that enable efficient storage and retrieval of data while not sacrificing utility (e.g., spatial operations).  MOL data storage happens across several tiers. Memcache and the Google App Engine datastore, for example, are used for simple, commonly requested data. Data on the back end is stored in the file directory, on CouchDB, or in a PostgreSQL-PostGIS database depending on the use cases for each data type.

                    <p>
                        Already now MOL has comprehensive data for over 23,000 vertebrate species 
                        ready for inclusion, and select data for tens of thousands additional 
                        animal and plant species is planned to be added over the next years. 
                        The MOL technical architecture needs to scale so that it can handle 
                        high volume concurrent user requests in a performant way. To achieve 
                        this, the architecture uses a hybrid server design that runs both in 
                        the cloud and locally. Servers running in the cloud are called the MOL 
                        front end. These servers have been designed to control all aspects of 
                        the application. To maximize throughput, it uses an extensive caching 
                        mechanism that stores only commonly requested data. It is built on Google 
                        App Engine, allowing the user to experience a very fast and responsive 
                        application, even during high-traffic periods. During low-traffic periods, 
                        the front-end application runs for less than one dollar a day. Servers 
                        running locally are called the MOL back end. These servers are built on 
                        hardware currently at the University of Colorado, with a planned mirror 
                        at Yale University. The back end is responsible for persistent data storage 
                        and replication, and long running processes required by MOL. The software 
                        deployed on the back end is streamlined to handle data requests proxied 
                        from the front end. A distributed task queue manages these requests which 
                        can be launched from web browsers, APIs, and the front end.

                    <p>
                        Data delivery has been optimized by relying on the various tiers of data storage. 
                        Any data requested from MOL is immediately cached on the front-end server for a 
                        limited period of time. This makes frequently requested data delivered as quickly 
                        as possible. Alternatively, data that is rarely requested remains on the back end 
                        until its first request, freeing up space in the front-end application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many components of data are better managed by projects outside MOL. For example, 
                        the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has a long history of making 
                        point occurrence data across numerous international collections accessible across 
                        the web. MOL relies on web-services made available by GBIF, which is temporarily 
                        cached on the front end server to increase speed and reliability.   The cached data 
                        is then displayed in the MOL user-interface.

                        MOL has diverse management challenges, from managing users and user privileges, 
                        managing user-provided quality-flags and data, to managing metadata about data 
                        sets and processes run for the MOL users. Every aspect of data management relies 
                        on those technological solutions outlined above, primarily scalability and 
                        delivery. MOL is exposing all data and metadata through a growing set of web-services 
                        that support discovery and data access. By doing so, MOL hopes to allow any user or 
                        application to utilize the outputs of the MOL project. While MOL is developing a 
                        user-interface that is targeted at expert and amateur users who can enhance the 
                        quality of species range data, the MOL team hopes that numerous positive (often 
                        unpredictable) outcomes will arise by encouraging other projects to build upon 
                        this set of data and tools.

                        The MOL web application facilitates data exploration, visualization, and enhancement. 
                        The user interface is built using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS and communicates with 
                        the MOL frontend using AJAX. It is highly modular and supports internationalization. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although development is in very early stages, some elements of the user interface 
                        have some prototypes in place. For example, you can visualize an IUCN range map with 
                        points discovered through GBIF 
                        <a href='/static/demo/range.png'>here</a>.
                        Note that only for some GBIF data we are currently (in red) visualizing 
                        spatial uncertainty of points, something that will (in a modeled/probabilistic way) 
                        be extended to all points. Of course users will be able to filter by year 
                        range, data provider etc. In the coming months we will add several 
                        other distribution data types and include expert maps for other vertebrate groups.
