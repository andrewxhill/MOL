                                Walter is broadly interested in global biodiversity science. His 
                                research is interdisciplinary and combines elements of biogeography, 
                                community ecology, landscape ecology, macroecology, global change 
                                ecology, evolutionary and comparative biology, biodiversity informatics 
                                and conservation. Study systems include terrestrial vertebrates, in 
                                particular birds, and plants. Work in his research group attempts to 
                                integrate across scales of geographical, phylogenetic and ecological 
                                organization.

                                Rob is a biodiversity scientist who studies spatiotemporal 
                                changes in genetic and species diversity. I take an integrative 
                                approach to global change biology and students in my lab range from 
                                occupancy and to spatial ecological modelers, to landscape geneticists, 
                                to systematists. The diversity in lab is also its strength -- we 
                                continue to discover that the interesting questions are the integrative 
                                ones that require multiple lines of evidence.  Rob hobbies are working

                                Dan is a postdoc in the Jetz lab at Yale. His research integrates broad

                                questions about the evolution, distribution and conservation of biological 
                                diversity. Dan is passionate about road cycling,

                                since the mid-2000's. Most of his work revolves around an enthusiasm

                                world's biodiversity. He has an affinity for caffiene and mostly avoids
