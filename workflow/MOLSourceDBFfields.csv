[1] Freshly added. Yes, have this one? --jetz.walter Monday, August 15, 2011 1:15:27 PM
[2] WJ: would the same comment you made re eventDate in MOLSourceFields apply here?

[3] how about just a string type (e.g., "native" instead of 1)
WJ: That would be fine, but takes up more space. We could have very consistent numbering here and just display meaning of a number ("native") in UI. We'd want this field to be searchable.
[4] how about just a string type (e.g., "extant" instead of 1)
WJ: See Origin.
[5] how about just a string type (e.g., "resident" instead of 1)
WJ: Suggested short ints for space saving, eas(ier) database joins
[6] is this id for joining on another file?

WJ: yes, for others or, later, MOL
