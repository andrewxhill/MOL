                            VISION:  The geography of life on Earth lies at the heart of the
                            interaction between nature and human society with its need for natural
                            resources. As disasters such as hurricanes or oil spills strike or the
                            climate changes, knowledge about the geography of biological diversity
                            – the types of species inhabiting a certain area – is essential for
                            informed and targeted action. Geographic data on species’
                            distributions are critical for governments, agencies and companies
                            seeking to make sound decisions about land management, health and
                            climate change policies or species conservation. Geographic range maps
                            are displayed in nature programs, zoos, and field guides to the
                            broader public worldwide and have myriad uses from basic science to
                            resource management, development and education.  Yet to date the
                            availability and quality of species range maps remains shockingly
                            dispersed and limited – in stark contrast with meter-level resolution
                            remotely sensed environmental information which is accessible
                            globally.  The time is now right to mobilize and, most importantly,
                            integrate species distribution information at global scale for
                            scientists and the public. The proposed “Map of Life” project will
                            host all available types of information about species distributions,
                            provide model-based integration, quantify uncertainty in individual
                            and integrated data types, and implement user feedback.

                            MOL Products: MOL will mobilize and integrate all key information
                            about species’ ranges that is currently spread over different research
                            domains: expert opinion maps, surveys over defined extents, point
                            observations (e.g. aggregated by GBIF) and voucher specimens, expert
                            habitat preferences, and others.  Combined with high resolution
                            (30-100m) remotely sensed data, a full statistical model-based
                            integration will be performed that allows for different data types to
                            complement each other.   The end result will be a knowledge-base of
                            initially tens and ultimately hundreds of thousands of species
                            distribution maps, along with a set of tools for querying, accessing,
                            modifying, downloading and summarizing them. Maps will be easily
                            re-provisioned in other applications such as Encyclopedia of Life
                            (eol.org).
